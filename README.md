I'm a graduate student with a Master's Degree in Data Science from the University at Buffalo-State University of New York (SUNY).

**My Journey**

💼 I have over 3 years of professional experience as a Business Data Analyst. During this time, I began exploring the field of data science by working on various data science projects.

🎓 Having developed a strong interest in data science, I pursued a degree to complement my skills with formal education and to sharpen my expertise.

🔍 During my degree, I undertook a co-op internship with Enquire AI, where I delved deep into AI/ML and Data Science projects. During my internship, I worked on several interesting projects, where I developed my skills on the below topics:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Large Language Model (LLM) integration
- Multi-agent AI workflows
- Fine-tuning
- API development
- Model deployment

📊 I'm continuously improving my Data Analysis skills by creating dashboards using Tableau and Power BI.

Additionally,

🌟 I’m a continuous and quick learner, a team player, and I have a keen eye for detail.

🔬 Outside of work and studies, I spend time reading books, listening to educational podcasts and playing sports.
